  Why Innovation as SDG?
  -Book search, borrowing, and return are just a few of the effective, automated procedures that a library management system (LMS) embodies. These procedures improve resource management and save time for users. The LMS is an additional example of innovation since it incorporates contemporary technology into customary library procedures and facilitates information accessibility via digital catalogs. Advances in user interface design and experience create a more approachable environment that promotes greater use of library services.
